static is intially used for memory management

static is linked with class

it can be used wiht
    -> blocks
    -> variables
    -> methods
    -> inner classes (nested classes)

-methods
    static methods cannot use non static variables
    in static methods non-static functions cannnot be called i.e is psvm we cannot call a non static function function of the same class
    this & super cant be used in static
    id we hava a child class that extends parent class and both of them has same static funtions with slight chnage, then the static function of referenced class will be executed


-static blocks
    static blocks of class executes when the class is laoded in memory
    it is only executed once no matter how many instances of the class are created
